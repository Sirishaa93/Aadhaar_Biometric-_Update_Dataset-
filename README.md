# Aadhaar_Biometric-_Update_Dataset-
Problem statement: Aadhaar Biometric Update dataset
This dataset contains aggregated information on biometric updates (modalities such as fingerprints, iris, and face). It reflects the periodic revalidation or correction of biometric details, especially for children transitioning into adulthood.

Solution: "This tool analyzes Aadhaar biometric datasets to identify districts where children (Age 5-17) are failing to update their biometrics."
